# inBrain Supplier API Demo
This project is a very bare bones implementation of the supplier API using PHP and jQuery.  In this example we use a simple ajax jQuery call to fetch surveys from inbrain as per the [documentation here](https://docs.inbrain.ai/docs/supplier-api/api-endpoints/fetch-surveys) on fetching surveys.

You will need to [create an account](https://publisher.inbrain.ai/account/signup) and get an API Key to use this demo project.
